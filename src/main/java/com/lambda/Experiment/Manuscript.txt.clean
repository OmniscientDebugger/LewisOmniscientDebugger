Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke

wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri

never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky

we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything .

come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more .

of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please

could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in

Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky

we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything .

come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more .

of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please

could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in

Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
team .

Palun Yuri whispered holding out a spoonfull of wurst to the cat . Please
this is just for you .

The cat a mangy old creature that had inhabited this crevice in the refuge
for as long as Yuri could remember stared at the boy suspiciously . Yuri
held very still and repeated Palun

Never taking its eyes off of Yuri the cat crept forward sniffed at the
wrust as if it expected it to be poisoned then snatched it off the spoon
and retreated to the safety of the crevice .

The cat bit into the wurst several times before finally swallowing it . It
never took its eyes off of Yuri .

Head Istu Yuri told the cat Bon Appetite . Yuri dug out another spoonful
of wurst and held it out to the cat . Did the cat care that Yuri spoke
Estonian with a slight Russian accent .  Maybe . In two years the cat had
never let Yuri touch it . It always grabbed the food from the spoon and
pulled back . If Yuri raised his hand to reach out towards the cat it would
arch its back and hiss . So Yuri never tried any more . 

It's ok cat . You're just like me . People are mean to us  because we're
small and ugly . The other boys hit me too . Yuri pulled back the hood
of his parka so the cat could see the small brown bruises where Karl and had
hit him that morning on the way to school .

I know what it's like for you . So don't worry . I'm your friend . We can be
friends from two meters away . Yuri dug out some more wurst .

The little hidden alcove in the courtyard off of Ruutli had been Yuri's
refuge after school for two years now . His mother gave piano lessons in
their tiny apartment on the other side of town and Yuri wasn't allowed to
come home until the last student was done . Yuri's father wanted him to go to
the ice hocky practice at the Linna Hall but Yuri hated it .

What kind of son are you .  His father would yell at him . I played for the
St . Petersburg city champions and you can't even handle a stick .   We are
Russians Yuri .  We are proud . We are strong . We are not afraid of anything . 
Do you hear me Yuri .   We lost twenty million men fighting the fascists but
we beat them .

His father would start pounding the table whenever he talked about the
war . All four of my grandparents died in the siege .  They gave their  lives
for mother Russia .  They died so you could ge free .  If there was any vodka
his father would down a swig and start talking about the 900 day siege . He
could talk for hours about the bravery of the St . Petersburg citizens in
resisting the fasists never Germans aways fascists) .

Then his father would talk about how hard his childhood had been about
never having enough to eat about the cold and of course about the  hocky
